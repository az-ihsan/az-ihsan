Ahmad here and I am part of Jülich Center for Neutron Scattering (JCNS), Forschungszentrum Jülich. This repository stores my daily works, interesting works, and things that I want to learn. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:
 
- 💬 Ask me about ontology, dislocation in crystalline materials, semantic web technologies, NLP, and LLMs.
- 📫 How to reach me: a.ihsan@fz-juelich.de
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play guitar 🎸  and go cycling/bike trip 🚴‍♂️ a lot
