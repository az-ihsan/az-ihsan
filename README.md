### Hi there 👋

Ahmad here. I am a last year PhD student at the Institute of Advanced Simulation – Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9), Forschungszentrum Jülich. This repository stores my daily works, interesting works, and things that I want to learn. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the ontology development especially in materials science and engineering domain, e.g., [DISOS](https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/Dislocation-Ontology-Suite) and [PRIMA](https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/MDMC-NEP-top-level-ontology)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) on processing the materials science related publications and text.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the ontology development, materials science related ontology development, and [PRIMA](https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/MDMC-NEP-top-level-ontology) use cases. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with NLP as I just started to learn this field. 
- 💬 Ask me about ontology, dislocation in crystalline materials, and a bit of NLP.
